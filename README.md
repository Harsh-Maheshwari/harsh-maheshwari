# Hi there, I'm Harsh Maheshwari  üëã
`(Hindi: ‡§π‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑, Meaning : Joy) | Data Scientist and Automation Freak`

`Last Updated In April 2022`

### Why I Do What I Do
I am a soul searching the meaning of life in Science and Religion. I am passionate about work, curious about science, driven by Minimalism, aware of my limits. I love data, enjoy travel, value loyalty, desire independence, appreciate honesty, trust life and above all respect time. I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Blue Yonder. I am also available as a freelance Data Science Consultant and a mentor for upcoming data science aspirants. Lastly, I am still a learner. Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, Financial Markets, or miscellaneous facts about the universe and physics. 

I love to watch anime some of my favorites are Dragon Ball Super, Death Note and Vinland Saga. I believe these productions represent the real depth of human psychology, efforts and emotions. My ultimate goal is a healthy and wealthy life for me and people around me. I believe in team work, extreme determination and self-belief as ingredients to success.

### Values : Go-Giver principles
1. **Value** : Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment
2. **Compensation**: Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them
3. **Influence**: Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people's interests first
4. **Authenticity**: The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself
5. **Receptivity** : The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving

## My Journey
### The Rough Game of JEE 2015-2017

After Completing my standard 10th in 2015, I left home for the first time to become an engineer and started my journey at IIT Home, Nagpur. I spent most of the next two years studying for JEE Advanced, listening to music, and meditating. Yep, It Works! After achieving an AIR of 735 in JEE Mains and 1382 in JEE Advanced, I joined the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay as a Chemical Engineering Fresher.

### 2017 June - 2018 June

Freshman year, I explored college events like XLR8 [Made my first manually controlled car], volunteered in Mood Indigo [Cultural Fest of IIT Bombay], participated in the annual entrepreneurship Summit of IIT Bombay [E-Summit]. My team achieved 3rd position among 30+ teams from IIT Bombay in Andro-NG, an Android app development competition. Completed a yearlong volleyball training and Won 3rd position in Street Play Arcade and Gold in Literary Arts GC for Hostel 2 [The Wild Ones]. And like any other freshmen, attended Blockchain seminars, Finance workshops, Start-up Bootcamps, and much more, only to realize that nothing helps until you do it yourself.

### 2018 June - 2018 December

Sophomore year, Through some of the course works, I developed an interest in Machine Learning. My first-course project in machine learning was on Hate & Offensive Speech Detection under Professor Sunita Sarawagi. I also joined Innovation Cell as a Finance and Infrastructure manager. In the December of 2018, I had my first professional work at PV-Diagnostics as a Data Analyst.

### The International year of 2019

One of the best parts of my college life includes the semester I spent in Denmark. I left India in January of 2019 to start my semester at the Technical University of Denmark as an exchange student. During my stay in Europe, I backpacked my way across 15 cities in 10 countries. I met many new people during my travel, learned a lot about European culture.¬†`#BackpackingThroughEurope`. As an exchange scholar, I worked in a Pilot-scale chemical plant on four different setups, namely Liquid-Liquid Extraction, Gas Flow in Pipes, Batch Distillation, Filtration in a Filter Press. During this semester, I understood the huge gap of professionalism in India Society and Education system. After a fantastic semester abroad, I came back to IIT Bombay and joined Innovation Cell again, but this time as a Computer Vision Engineer building deep learning models for advanced vehicles like automated drones for the Barcelona Smart Drone Challenge and self-driving cars. It was a learn and apply journey. Then in November of 2019, I was fortunate enough to grab a research opportunity at the National University of Singapore. I spent a month and a half researching deep learning methods and their application in Network Graphs and Link Prediction Problem in Singapore under the guidance of Professor Bryan Hooi.

### 2020 The Year of coming Home - The Time of SARS-CoV-2

After traveling so much, I knew the lifestyle I wanted. College experiences and internships helped me figure out I loved data science and deep learning. In subsequent semesters of junior year, I worked on many different projects involving deep learning and machine learning applications. I worked with professor Sharad Bhartiya on the Modelling & Identification of Gas sensor data for a dynamic chemical gas mixture. In the summer of 2020, I grabbed an opportunity at Axis Bank to work in their Business Intelligence team. After two months of work, I created a micro-service on Kubernetes and Docker to predict customer income using Geospatial and Customer Information data. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, many things changed, and quite a lot of effort got into adjusting to the new normal. Everyone was now working from home, and all colleges were now virtual. After a blissful summer, I started my final year working under Professor Sharad Bhartiya to study machine learning methods for the prediction of financial markets. Due to this project, my interest was peaking towards the financial markets, and my background in machine learning drove me towards algorithmic trading and quantitative finance. And then, in a LinkedIn post, I got to know about the book on generating Predictive Models to Extract Signals from Market by Stefan Jansen. It is one of the best books on applications of Machine learning in the Market. Placements for my batch began in the December of 2020. After three days of struggle, Australia and New Zealand bank Bangalore office accepted me for a Data Lifecycle Evolution role.

### The Last Semester Jan 2021 - May 2021

During the last five months of my undergraduate degree, we were all still at home [Gift of SARS-CoV-2]. I will regret this to the end of time. But still, our professors made sure that we get the experience of the actual chemical industry as much as possible. Over the length of 5 months, I was involved in developing extensively detailed reports on producing three chemicals, namely Ethylene Oxide, Styrene, and Dihydromyrcene [my favorite]. These projects were part of our curriculum, and many professors contributed by helping us at various steps. As the end came near, everything became so nostalgic.

### The First Job June 2021 - March 2022

I started working at ANZ Bank as a fresh graduate out of college. For the first few months I learned about the way data sourcing activities are taking place for the Enterprise data. The major technologies involved in this process were IBM Data Stage, Teradata and Control M. After understanding and manually going over the dataflow for the ANZ datalake, I was able to figure out many processes that could be automated in the daily workload. The next few months majority of my time spent taking input from teams regarding the usefulness and possible structure of such a system. After the initial approval I developed a complete Development and Test Automation Framework using Robot Framework and Python. I was able to minimize the effort to a level where we just had to fill an excel sheet and the rest would happen automatically. Starting from picking up data from a unix server to loading it into a Teradata Table using Data Stage. To verify if the data was loaded properly, set of python functions where developed which would log into Teradata to download the loaded data and compare with the original file. I can not go into more details about the product but this saved a lot of Development time and Testing time Other then my job work I lead a Tech4Grads initiative with the aim to bring technological awareness and cross collaboration in the Tech Domain. We ran projects like Building a Market Place and Tech Awareness. Both of these projects were developed as a POC under the Graduate community at ANZ and the aim was to bring about a cultural tradition in technology by new graduates that come to ANZ every year.  
One of the very interesting thing I learned at ANZ was Agile working and role of a scrum master in a team. For all of my next projects (at least personal projects) I have decided to use an Agile mindset and approach every thing for Agile First Approach.
