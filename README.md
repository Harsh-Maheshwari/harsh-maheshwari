#  Hi there, I'm Harsh Maheshwari  üëã
`(Hindi: ‡§π‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑, Meaning : Joy) | Data Scientist and Automation Freak`

## About the Creator
To view open source products that I have built go to my portfolio @  [harsh-maheshwari.github.io/harsh-maheshwari](https://harsh-maheshwari.github.io/harsh-maheshwari). 
This website contains writing on different topics that I try to learn about. Professionally I am a Full Stack Data Scientist working at Blue Yonder. 

###  Why I Do What I Do
I am a soul searching the meaning of life in Science and Religion. I am passionate about work, curious about science, driven by Minimalism, aware of my limits. I love data, enjoy travel, value loyalty, desire independence, appreciate honesty, trust life and above all respect time. I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Blue Yonder. I am also available as a freelance Data Science Consultant and a mentor for upcoming data science aspirants. Lastly, I am still a learner. Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, Financial Markets, or miscellaneous facts about the universe and physics. 

I love to watch anime some of my favorites are Dragon Ball Super, Death Note and Vinland Saga. I believe these productions represent the real depth of human psychology, efforts and emotions. My ultimate goal is a healthy and wealthy life for me and people around me. I believe in team work, extreme determination and self-belief as ingredients to success.

### Beliefs : Go-Giver principles
1. **Value** : Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment
2. **Compensation**: Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them
3. **Influence**: Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people's interests first
4. **Authenticity**: The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself
5. **Receptivity** : The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving
