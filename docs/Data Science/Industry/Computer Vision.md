## Computer Vision as a Service 
**Object recognition** (also called object **classification**) – One or several pre-specified or learned objects or object classes 
can be recognized, usually together with their 2D positions in the image or 3D poses in the scene. \n

**Identification** – An individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's 
face (Facial recognition) or fingerprint (Biometric recognition), identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle. \n

**Detection** – The image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or 
tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and 
fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more 
computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.\n

**Object Tracking** – Following the movements of a (usually) smaller set of interest points or objects (e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms) in the image sequence. This has vast industry applications as most of high running machineries can be monitored in this way.

**Content-based image retrieval** – Finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can 
be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image (give me all images similar to image X), 
or in terms of high-level search criteria given as text input (give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter, 
and have no cars in them).Computer vision for people counter purposes in public places, malls, shopping centres\n

**Pose estimation** – Estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for 
this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking 
parts from a bin.\n

**Optical character recognition (OCR)** – Identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to 
encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing (e.g. ASCII).\n

**Shape Recognition Technology** (SRT) in people counter systems differentiating human beings (head and shoulder patterns) from objects\n

## Computer Vision in Industry 
Whether it is medical diagnosis, self-driving vehicles, camera monitoring, or smart filters, many applications 
in the field of computer vision are closely related to our lives. Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, 
analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical 
or symbolic information. Applications of computer vision range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, 
inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can 
comprehend the world around them. Some of the best examples of Computer Vision in Industry are:

* **Automatic inspection**: In manufacturing applications
* **Identification tasks**: Assisting humans in species identification system
* **Controlling processes**: Controlling an industrial robot
* **Detecting events**: Visual surveillance or people counting in the restaurant industry
* **Interaction**: Used as the input to a device for computer-human interaction
* **Modeling environments**: Medical image analysis or topographical modeling
* **Navigation**: For autonomous vehicle or mobile robot
* **Organizing information**: For indexing databases of images and image sequences.
* **Data Transformation**: Transfer style and other characteristic of one image to other 
* **2D code reading** – Reading of 2D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.
