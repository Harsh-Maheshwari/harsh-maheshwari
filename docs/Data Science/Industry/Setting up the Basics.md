## Operating System
If you really want to do machine learning, ditch windows and come to linux. Start with Ubuntu or Pop Os,  get the latest LTS (Long Term Support) Version and install it on your machine as a [Dual Boot](https://blnlabs.com/dual-boot-pop-os-and-windows-10/). I prefer Pop Os.

## Applications 
- Install Python by following [this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-on-linux/)
- Install [Pycharm community version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux). Here is a [perfect article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-pycharm-on-linux/) for guidance
